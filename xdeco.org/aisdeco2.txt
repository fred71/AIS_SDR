AisDeco2 v.20150415

+ changes in code
+ small bugs fixed

+ added algorithm to automatically adjust the level of the input signal.
+ changes in the GMSK decoder.

This is a console (command line) AIS decoder program specifically designed for RTLSDR devices,that can do:
- Simultaneously receive TDMA modulated signals in two frequencies: 161975 kHz and 162025 kHz of marine AIS channels 87/88.
- Decode the AIS data which were encapsulated within the Marine Standard NMEA protocol.
- Transmit !AIVDM messages to network in two modes: through its own TCP server on Port and UDP/IP client to remote server on IP:Port.
  In UDP mode the IP address where the data should be sent to. This can be in the usual Ipv4 format (xx.xx.xx.xx)
  or it can be a valid host address accepted by the standard function inet_addr. For example, localhost is equivalent to 127.0.0.1 and ShipPlotter default port 4159.

Example:

C:\>aisdeco2.exe --gain 33.8 --freq-correction 68 --freq 161975000 --freq 162025000 --net 30007 --udp 127.0.0.1:4159

When try to launch the modesdeco can get an error that msvcp110.dll or/and msvcr110.dll is missing.
Please, get the actual Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 from the Microsoft site:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30679

Download Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 from Official Microsoft Download Center.
You will need the 32 bit version: VSU_4\vcredist_x86.exe regardless of what bitness have your operating system.
The Visual C++ Redistributable Packages install runtime components that are required to run C++ applications built with Visual Studio 2012.

In the archive aisdeco_xp.exe is the same program, but was compiled with Windows XP (v110_xp) platform toolset for compatibility with windows XP.
Only aisdeco_xp.exe that are created by using the v110_xp toolset support Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. 


To successfully receiving AIS signals by RTL dongle, in addition to using the proper antenna-feeder device,
need to determine the true value of error correction of dongle oscillator in ppm.
Correction of error need to do exactly at the frequency of 162 MHz and with sample rate 1.4 MSPS, for example, in SDR# (See picture sdrsharp_ppm.jpg)

AIS signals look like small horizontal lines on the waterfall and if you are listening to its through your speakers, they will just sound like blips of noise.
The signals may not appear exactly on 161975 kHz or 162025 kHz labels of tuning scale, since of error dongle oscillator.
Just tune manually by changing the value in window "Frequency correction" until the signals are properly centered.
Use "Zoom" knob to zoom signals on the waterfall to see signals better.
